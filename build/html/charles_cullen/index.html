<ul class="simple">
<li>number of victims and date of first are estimated</li>
</ul>
<p>Charles Cullen, born February 22, 1960, was the youngest of eight children. Cullen described his own childhood as “miserable.” He lost his father when he was only seven months old. He attempted suicide when he was nine, which was the first of many time that he would try to kill himself. He then lost his mother in a car accident when he was 17. He then dropped out of school, joined the Navy where he started to show signs of instability in his mental state. In the coming years, he would try seven times to commit suicide before receiving a medical discharge.</p>
<p>Cullen then started working as a nurse, the job that enabled his many killings. He used overdose to kill his victims. Cullen later claimed that he was attempting to save his victims from pain and suffering. He evaded suspicion for years due to loose laws regarding the transfer of allegations between hospitals and a shortage of nurses.</p>
<p>Charles Cullen is believed to be the most prolific serial killer in American history, though it is unknown exactly how many people he killed. He was arrested and convicted in 2003 and now serves a life sentence.</p>
<p>Cullen was allowed to donate a kidney to the relative of a former girlfriend in 2006.</p>
