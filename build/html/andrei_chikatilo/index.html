<h1>Andrei Chikatilo<a class="headerlink" href="#andrei-chikatilo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Andrei Chikatilo, born October 16, 1936, grew up in Ukraine, a part of the USSR at the time. His early life was defined by suffering. The USSR faced widespread famine due to poor agricultural planning, made worse when they entered World War II. In addition to this, it is widely believed that Chikatilo suffered from hydrocephalus, water on the brain, at birth. In addition, Chikatilo paid the price for his father being captured during the war through consistent bullying at school.</p>
<p>Chikatilo’s crimes are believed to have been a form of sexual release, as the hydrocephalus hindered his ability to maintain an erection and staining his sexual relations. His victims were often young, found and befriended at bus stops and train stations before being led to their deaths in nearby wooded areas. He used a knife to mutilate his victims, often removing sexual organs and or eyes.</p>
<p>During his court case in April 1992, he was held in an iron cage, separating him from the family of his many victims. He was found guilty of 52 of 53 murders that he was charged with. The sentence for each was death and he was executed on Valentine’s Day in 1994.</p>
