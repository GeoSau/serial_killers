============== ============================

Dennis Rader, born in 1945, lived his entire life in Wichita, Kansas. He led a normal life. However, he would go on to lead a double life, a devoted family man by day, serial killer by night.

After killing his first victims, a family of four, Rader left a note in a library book and tipped it off to the newspaper. In it, he claimed responsibility for the murders under the name BTK, short for "bind them, torture them, murder them."

He would go on to kill 6 more people and attempt to kill one more. Each time he would communicate to the police what he had done. He made special care to make sure the communication was untraceable. He would be captured when he abandoned his careful approach in favor of leaving a floppy disk.

He is currently facing 10 consecutive life sentences.
