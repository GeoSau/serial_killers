orphaned boys between the ages of six and sixteen. The youngest boy he raped 
and killed was a six month old boy. Luis Garavito eventually turned himself in 
and was charged with the torture, rape, and murder of 147 young boys. Because of 
his extensive amounts of serve crime in 1999 Luis Garavito was charged with 
1853 years in jail. However, according to Colombian law no person can be in
prison longer than 30 years. This means the latest Luis Garavito could be
