Luis Garavito, also known as **The Beast** or **Goofy**, was the most infamous serial killer and rapist from Columbia. He mainly targeted poor, homeless or orphaned boys between the ages of six to sixteen. The youngest boy he had raped and killed is a six month old boy. Luis Garavito eventually turned himself in and was charged with the torture, rape, and murder of 147 young boys. Because of his extensive amounts of server crime in 1999 Luis Garavito was charged with 1853 years in jail. However, according to Colombian law no person can be in prison longer than 30 years. This means the latest Luis Garavito could be released is 2029 and it could be earlier if he has good behavior.
