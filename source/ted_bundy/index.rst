General Overview
----------------
Theodore Bundy was born out of wedlock and raised by his grandparents, which he was told where his parents. He only found out the truth when he discovered his birth certificate. His mother later married and Bundy was adopted. Other than this, Bundyâ€™s childhood was relatively uneventful. Bundy was typically described as well-liked, kind, or charismatic. He was also smart, even making it into law school. He may have started killing as a teenager, but he refused to officially confess any crimes before his murders of female college students near Seattle, Washington. After this first series of murders, Bundy was offered as a possible suspect, but law enforcement did not pursue him because they could not believe a well-recommended law-student with no history of crimes would be the murderer. His second series of murders took place around Salt Lake City, Utah. In both series he kidnapped, raped, and killed the women. Bundy was arrested after this second string or murders. Bundy managed to escape and commit more murders in Florida where he was put on trial again, this time he was sentenced to death.
