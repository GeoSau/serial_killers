============== ============================



Kearney, born in 1940, had a relatively normal childhood. Being a thin and sickly-looking child, he was the victim of bullying. Compared to many other serial killers, this isn't anything particularly extraordinary.

His victims were young male hitch-hikers and young men from gay bars. He would pick them up and shoot them without warning. He was a necrophiliac, and would take off with the bodies, dismember them, and toss them into the desert or along the freeway. He usually wrapped bodies in in garbage bags, leading to his nickname the serial killer.

He came under suspicion after killing a man that had come looking for his partner, David Hill. The man had told someone that he had planned to go to Hill's house, so the police came to investigate. After they left, Hill and Kearney fled. They would later turn themselves in and Hill would be cleared of any involvement.

Kearney is currently facing a life sentence.
