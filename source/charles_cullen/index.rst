Charles Cullen, born February 22, 1960, was the youngest of eight children. 
Cullen described his own childhood as "miserable." He lost his father when he 
was only seven months old. He attempted suicide when he was nine, which was the 
first of many times that he would try to kill himself. He then lost his mother in 
a car accident when he was 17. He then dropped out of school and joined the Navy, 
where he started to show signs of instability in his mental state. In the coming 
years, he would try seven times to commit suicide before receiving a medical 
discharge.

Cullen then started working as a nurse, the job that enabled his many killings. 
He used overdoses to kill his victims. Cullen later claimed that he was 
attempting to save his victims from pain and suffering. He evaded suspicion for 
years due to loose laws regarding the transfer of allegations between hospitals 
and a shortage of nurses. 

Charles Cullen is believed to be the most prolific serial killer in American 
history, though it is unknown exactly how many people he killed. He was arrested 
and convicted in 2003 and now serves a life sentence.

Cullen was allowed to donate a kidney to the relative of a former girlfriend in 
2006. 'A news article on it from NBC'_
