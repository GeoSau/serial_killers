Killer Lobster Boy!
===================

Grady Stiles also known as ‘The Lobster Boy,’ was born in Pittsburg. He was 
part of the side show performing during carnival season. He was a performer 
because of his deformities. He had ectrodactyly, which was when the toes would 
combine to form lobster like claws, this affected both his hands and his feet. 
Since he had this sickness, he was not able to walk. This made him confined to a
wheelchair all day every day. Since he was always in his wheel chair and used 
his arms to move, he had a strong upper body. Grady, later in life, had a family 
of 3 children and a wife. This was not a good family though. He would 
regularly beat his wife and children. His main weapons when beating his family 
where his hands as he would use his pincher like hand to choke this family. 
Many of the killings that this man had committed where because of his short 
temper. For example, he killed his daughter’s boyfriend because they wanted to 
get married young. The boyfriend tried to stand up for himself; however, Grady, 
even though at a physical disadvantage, killed the boyfriend.
