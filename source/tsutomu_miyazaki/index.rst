General Overview
----------------
Tsutomu Miyazaki was born with a deformity where his hands and wrists were one 
which caused a lack in range of motion and gnarled hands. This deformity meant 
that Miyazaki ridiculed and had no real friends. He also found no one to confide 
in within his family. As for his murders, he was convicted for the murders of 
four young girls ranging from four to seven years old. After killing them he 
molested them and even their blood sometimes. He would also send mementos, 
sometimes including body parts, ashes, or clothing, to their families along with 
a recount of the girl’s murder. During the trial he claimed he had an alter ego, 
he called him “Rat Man,” who had made him murder the girls. However, the court 
judged him aware of and accountable for his acts. Anime temporarily got a bad 
reputation in the area after these murders because of the large collection
 Miyazaki owned.
