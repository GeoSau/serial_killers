General Overview
----------------
The identity of the Zodiac Killer still has not been determined. The killer is 
most notorious for his communication with the police and local newspapers. Some 
of the letters he sent contained cryptograms. There were four of these 
cryptograms and he teased that if the police cracked the code, they would “have 
him.” Only one of the cytograms has been solved, and not even all of it. It 
talks of him killing for the fun of it, but also so that his victims will be his
slaves in the afterlife. For this reason he says he will never reveal his name.
He also sent mementos from the crime scenes with some of his other letters. 
He, or someone claiming to be him, also contacted the police department via a 
phone call and even arranged a meeting with one of the lawyers on the case,
which he never followed through with. All of his correspondences were signed 
off with the following symbol. For more information check out this link!
